Congratulations, you've made it to the final week in the course! The last week of this course is dedicated to the final project. For the final project, you will apply all the skills you've learned in this course by providing systems administration consultation. You will assess the IT infrastructure of three fictitious (but very real-life based!) companies and provide recommendations and advice about how to support their IT infrastructure. By the end of this project, you will demonstrate the skills and problem-solving techniques of a SysAdmin. Good luck!
